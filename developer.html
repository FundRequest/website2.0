                            <p>We at FundRequest believe that blockchain technology and smart contracts can help us cut the middle men and evolve to a decentralized society where developers can reap the benefits of their work and where companies pay only for the support and development they need.</p>
                            <p>To this end, we have built FundRequest on the cryptocurrency platform Ethereum. One of Ethereum’s key features is a system of “Smart Contracts”. This enables us to program contractual requirements that are partially or fully self-executing – an automated “if-then” clause, if you will.</p>
