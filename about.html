                            <h2>WHAT IS FUNDREQUEST?</h2>
                            <p>FundRequest is a monetization platform built on blockchain technology, that allows anybody to fund open issues on any open source project in a fast and easy way. Funding a request takes only a minute, and doesn’t require any coding skills.</p>
                            <p>With FundRequest, any user can create a contractual reward to solve a problem, fix a bug or implement a feature. Funds are allocated to a specific issue, and when a developer solves the problem or develops the feature, he/she receives the reward.</p>
                            <p>At first, FundRequest will be integrating with Github and Stack Exchange, but our goal is to evolve into a system that can be used to fund and reward any community platform.</p>
